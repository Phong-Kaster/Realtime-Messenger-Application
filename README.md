[Facebook Messenger](https://www.facebook.com/) , [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/?lang=en) , [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/features/skype-web/) doesn't respect your private ?  Advertisements make you annoy ? You want some chatting application which protects your information & encrypts every single messenger  ? It's simple ðŸ˜† Get into Realtime Messenger Application .

## [**The reason why I write**](#the-reason-why-i-write-)
When I make a start , I have been just a third-year student in [Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology HCM Branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posts_and_Telecommunications_Institute_of_Technology,_Ho_Chi_Minh_City).So I am hungry for a challenge , I want to learn & build some thing usefully . In addition , it can make employer impressive,so on ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜‹
## [**Architecture**](#architecture)

What type of architecture have I used ? I have written this application following **Model-View-Controller** architecture

## [**Installation**](#installation)
In folder `public/bower_components` contains third-party libraries.They have the same feature like `node_modules` so that I do not want to commit them to Github. To address the problem , [Bower](https://bower.io/#getting-started) was used to managing these libraries.

We have 2 important bower file:

1.bowerrc : it tell our PC where our libraries will be stored.There I choose `public` folder to store them

       {
              "directory": "public/"
       }

2.bower.json : configuration file include many valuable information and what URL we have to download ?

To active , run :

        bower install

Installation will be activated automatically.

## [**Features**](#features)

1. User Account Manager Functions

    1.1 Login : It is known that login function is one of the most important function with every chat application.It's a difficult function for me.Overcome all the obstacle,I completed this function.So every single user can log in by 3 different ways : Local Account,Facebook Account & Google Account.[PassportJS](http://www.passportjs.org/) & [node_mailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) were used to build up.
 
 With Facebook Account & Google Account , user can easily login by matched icons.
 
 With Local Account , after signing up successfully , they have to activate their account by click the link from verify e-mail.
