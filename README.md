# [**Introduction**](#introduction)

[Facebook Messenger](https://www.facebook.com/) , [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/?lang=en) , [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/features/skype-web/) doesn't respect your private ?  Advertisements make you annoy ? You want some chatting application which protects your information & encrypts every single messenger  ? It's simple üòÜ Get into Realtime Messenger Application . I can do it for you & for free forever ü§ó.This is my idea


# [**The reason why I write**](#the-reason-why-i-write-)
When I make a start , I have been just a third-year student in [Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology HCM Branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posts_and_Telecommunications_Institute_of_Technology,_Ho_Chi_Minh_City).So I am hungry for a challenge , I want to learn & build some thing usefully . In addition , it can make employer impressive,so on üòéüòã
# [**Architecture**](#architecture)

What type of architecture have I used ? I have written this application following **Model-View-Controller** architecture

# [**Installation**](#installation)
In folder `public/bower_components` contains third-party libraries.They have the same feature like `node_modules` so that I do not want to commit them to Github. To address the problem , [Bower](https://bower.io/#getting-started) was used to managing these libraries.

We have 2 important bower file:

**bowerrc** : it tell our PC where our libraries will be stored.There I choose `public` folder to store them.You can decide where the files will be stored after finishing process

       {
              "directory": "public/"
       }

**bower.json** : configuration file include many valuable information and what URL we have to download ? .This code below tell the application where to retrieve these files.You can push them to your github and replace the link below with your GitHub link

       "dependencies": 
       {
              "bower_components": "https://github.com/trungquan17/awesome-chat-third-party-libraries.git"
       }

To active , run :

        bower install

Installation will be activated automatically.

[PassportJS](http://www.passportjs.org/) & [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) were used to build up.
 
With Facebook Account & Google Account : people user their Facebook account or Google account to  login by matched methods.
